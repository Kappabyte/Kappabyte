# Avery Keuben
Hi, I'm Avery, a high school student in Alberta, Canada with a passion for programming and solving puzzles. I am currently seeking internship oppertunities over the summer.

## My Projects
I have many projects in various states of completion:

### Main Projects
- KappaEngine - This is a simple LWJGL game engine programmed in Java to help me learn low-level graphics programming using openGL. This project is still in an early stage, but has provided me the oppertunity to learn.
- EventAPI - A spigot library designed to allow for the easy implementation of hosted even style games on minecraft servers. The project is currently in 1.0 release.
- MinecraftMapGUI - A gui application to easily launch minecraft servers for playing your favorite maps. Supports multiple minecraft versions. Written using react and electron in typescript.

### Secondary Projects
- The Dungeon - This is a procedurally generated 2D dungeon crawling game written in Processing for my Computer Science 10 final project. This project is in its final state.
- Kappabot - My general purpose discord bot. Written using discord.js, this bot allows for music to be played in voice channels, with more features comming soon. The project is currently being rewritten in typescript.
- DotMarch - A simple website to create a visual representation of your "dots" for a field show, creating a printable PDF. Currently in a pre-alpha state, and in a private repo.

## Goals
My goal is to become a backend, frontend, or full stack developer for a software development company. I would like to continue to learn new frameworks, APIs, and languages as I continue my path to a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science. I am also interested in improving my project organization and planning skills to help me complete more projects.
